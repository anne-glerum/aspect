# This model has a box geometry where simple shear is induced by constant velocity
# along the bottom and top boundaries. Diffusion dislocation creep laws corresponding
# to the model of Hirth and Kohlstedt for dry olivine are used, and the viscosity is
# calculated at the first time step for a constant temperature of 1600 K.
# Since the strain rate is fixed, and diffusion viscosity is also fixed at 1e21Pas
# it is possible to compute the corresponding dislocation and effective viscosity and
# check the model for correctness. However there are several pitfalls:
# - The strain-rate visualization plugins computes a different norm for the strain
#   rate than what is used in the material model. The internal strain rate was determined
#   to be 6.33775e-14
# - Even using this viscosity in the accompanying python script gives a deviation by
#   about one percent to the analytical viscosity, source so far unknown.
#
#   Analytically (python script) computed dislocation viscosity: 8.51786311699e+18
#   Numerically (ASPECT) computed dislocation viscosity: 8.57e18
#
#   This is about the same difference as between pure dislocation viscosity and
#   effective (disl + diffusion) viscosity, but I was careful to only compare
#   dislocation viscosities. 
#
# Note that the strain rate output by aspect is the *norm*, but the model itself uses
# the square root of the second invariant. For reference, edot_norm = sqrt(2*edot_ii).
# The depth average output contains viscosity output, and so provides the required test.
